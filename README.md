# DISSE: a toolkit for modelling and simulating distributed systems.

DISSE is a new software library for modelling and simulating distributed systems. It is written in Golang and is open source and available on GitHub.

DISSE is designed to be used by researchers, students, and engineers who are interested in distributed algorithms. It can be used to study the behaviour of different algorithms, to compare different algorithms, and to design new algorithms.

DISSE provides a high-level API for creating models of distributed systems. These models can be used to create simulations that tests the behaviour of distributed system under various conditions.

Additionally, DISSE provides a variety of tools for analysing the results of simulations.
