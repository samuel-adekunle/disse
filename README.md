# DISSE: a Library for Modelling and Simulating Distributed Systems.

DISSE is designed to be used by researchers, students, and engineers who are interested in distributed algorithms. It can be used to study the behaviour of different algorithms, to compare different algorithms, and to design new algorithms.

DISSE provides a high-level API for creating models of distributed systems. These models can be used to create simulations that tests the behaviour of distributed system under various conditions.

Additionally, DISSE provides a comprehensive logging system for obtaining various outputs from the simulations.

View the standard library for modules which implement common distributed systems algorithms [here](./lib/README.md).

For examples of how to use the library, see the [examples](./examples/README.md).
