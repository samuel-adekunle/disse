# Distributed Systems Discrete Event Simulator (DISSE)

A discrete event simulation library for distributed systems.

View the documentation [here](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/samuel-adekunle/disse).

View the standard library for modules which implement common distributed systems algorithms [here](./lib/README.md).

For examples of how to use the library, to create custom modules and run simulations, see the [examples](./examples/README.md).
