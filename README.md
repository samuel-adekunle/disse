# Distributed Systems Discrete Event Simulator (DISSE)

DISSE is a new software library for modelling and simulating distributed algorithms. It is written in Golang and is open source and available on GitHub.

DISSE provides a high-level API for creating models of distributed systems. These models can be used to simulate the behaviour of different distributed algorithms. DISSE also provides a variety of tools for analysing the results of simulations.

DISSE is designed to be used by researchers, students, and engineers who are interested in distributed algorithms. It can be used to study the behaviour of different algorithms, to compare different algorithms, and to design new algorithms.

For examples of how to use the library, to create custom modules and run simulations, see the [examples](./examples/README.md).

View the standard library for modules which implement common distributed systems algorithms [here](./lib/README.md).
