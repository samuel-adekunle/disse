# Future Work
- [ ] Make Address an empty interface and use a LocalAddress type for LocalNode and LocalSimulation
- [ ] Make LocalNode fully implement the Node interface
- [ ] Design a language agnostic way to specify simulations, using a JSON or YAML file
- [ ] Mature the Node and Simulation interfaces to be more useful for implementing other protocols
- [ ] Create TCPSimulation and TCPNode, UDPSimulation and UDPNode, etc.
- [ ] Add more examples of how to use the framework
- [ ] Add more modules to the standard library
- [ ] Design a model checking framework to test if an algorithm is implemented correctly
