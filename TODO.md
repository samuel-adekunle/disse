# Future Work
- [ ] Change Interrupts to also send across the netowrk, might not be realistic to send across networks
- [ ] Make Address an empty interface and use a LocalAddress type for LocalNode and LocalSimulation
- [ ] Make LocalNode fully implement the Node interface
- [ ] Design a language agnostic way to specify simulations, using a JSON or YAML file
- [ ] Mature the Node and Simulation interfaces to be more useful for implementing other protocols
- [ ] Create TCPSimulation and TCPNode, UDPSimulation and UDPNode, etc.
- [ ] Add more examples of how to use the framework
- [ ] Add more modules to the standard library
- [ ] Design a model checking framework to test if an algorithm is implemented correctly
- [ ] Add a Restart Interrupt, and figure out how to design simulations where nodes can leave and rejoin at will
- [ ] Give Nodes persistent storage
- [ ] Implement custom timer libraries to enable interactive simulation where users can pause and play simulatino and inspect the state of nodes, i.e. a true debugger, perhaps with breakpoints.
